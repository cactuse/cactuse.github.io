I’m a Marketing Professional with a strong sense of purpose, narrative and visual aesthetics. I build brands for the digital age, humanizing their presence across platforms and harmonizing messaging across geographies.

Since 2012 I’ve built my career in multiple European markets working on advertising and marketing, awareness and communication projects and creative production, earning some awards and professional certificates along the way.

I can’t wait to discover what Berlin has to offer – and to learn German!
